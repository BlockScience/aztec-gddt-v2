    "A *scenario group* refers to a set of experiments where the goal is to understand the impact of pre-defined random variables or uncertain parameters on metrics of interest.  Each scneario group is classified within one of 4 major categories: fee mechanism, staking/slashing, L2 congestion, and block reward. In total, we have identified 9 scenario groups, as follows:\n",

    "Because an exhaustive 'sweep' of every possible combination of relevant protocol parameters is computationally infeasible, the *methodology* used in this study instead performes **an adaptive search**, whereby a coarse initial grid of parameters is successively refined by applying the success criteria to generated KPIs, and inferring a new 'direction' of search for a succeeding grid. Convergence is achieved when all success criteria are met across the performed simulations. Although it is always possible that multiple \"equilibria\" exist, such that success criteria are met by parameter combinations that are not found from adaptive search, the initial grid is informed by existing parameter values from the Pocket network and hence benefit from the expert knowledge used to define those initial values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Future work can perform a more thorough search of the underlying parameter space, in addition to performing more demand scenarios and realizations from the exogenous distributions that represent external factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Description and discussion of the computational experiments **for each** scenario group is structured as follows: (1) objective, (2) experimental setup, (3) computational complexity, (4) adaptive grid results, (5) protocol parameter recommendations, (6) decision tree and parameter importance, (7) parameter impact on metrics and (8) conlusion.\n",
    "\n",

    ":::spoiler **Objective**\n",
    "\n",
    "The *objective* of a computational experiment, regarding a specific scenerio group, is to gather valuable insights around targeted goals and guide important business decisions, such as the sensitivity of the transactions fee to the rollup contract parameters determined by one or more outside 'oracles', or the cost for an attacker to control up to x% of the validator committee.  \n",

    "- **Simulation input/output per Monte Carlo run**: Input corresponds to a parameter, list of parameters or simulated time series of the uncertain parameter(s) affecting the experiment under study. Output corresponds to a system variable(s) useful to determine the value of the experiment's specified metric(s).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sweep parameters**: Set of uncertain parameters taking on a user--specified value at each simulation run, referred to as sweep parameters. These parameters jointly determine/affect the simulation input needed to test a scenario group.  Such parameters can be divided into two categories: control and environmental.\n",

    "- **Simulation behavior**: Rule or set of rules implemented in the simulation reflecting the actions taken by agents (e.g., a sequencer) or the state change of an object (e.g., transaction), conditional upon the ocurrence of a pre-defined event. For instance, a simulation behavior may be such that a sequencer will not post a block to L1 *if* the revenue from the block is less than the cost of posting the block.\n",

    "\n",
    "The evolution of the parameter selection process is presented as a visualization, showing the convergence of the protocol parameter ranges as different success criteria are achieved. Both, control and environmental parameters were initialized for the first adaptive grid search according to discussions with the Aztec team, and BlockScience best practice.\n",

    "::: spoiler **Decision Tree and Parameter Importance**\n",
    "Using the adaptive grid results, a **decision tree** is built to infer the importance of different parameters on the associated KPI-based threshold inequalities. This provides a method of assessing whether one or more parameters are 'crucial' to success, in the sense that they have an outsized impact on the success criteria. This approach leverages decision trees that are fit to the results of the entire adaptive grid process.\n",
    "\n",
    "To provide guidance on how to interpret such decision tree, below we include a formal definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Decision Tree Classification**\n",
    "\n",
    "A decision tree is a machine-learning-based classifier. Given the simulation results, for each threshold inequality the tree recursively associates different samples from the results, according to sorting criteria based upon one or more of the protocol parameters of the simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each decision tree below corresponds to one of the threshold inequalities stated above. Where the decision tree is 'empty', the threshold inequality was either 1) always fulfilled during the simulations, or 2) never fulfilled during the simulations. In this case no sensitivity analysis can be performed, as the threshold inequalities do not vary according to the different parameter combinations that were swept.\n",
    "\n",
    "The title of the decision tree includes the threshold inequality under scrutiny, in addition to a technical 'score' (usually \"100%\") and the number of simulation results used as the dataset. Within the decision tree presented, each non-terminal 'node' is labeled with the following information:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The sorting variable used and its cutoff value used for classification, in the form of `parameter_name <= x` where `x` is the cutoff value. Branches to the left of this node indicate satisfaction of this inequality, while branches to the right indicate violations, i.e. `parameter_name > x`.\n",
    "2. A Gini coefficient representing the method of recursive association used.\n",
    "3. The total number of simulation results (\"samples = y%\") as a percentage \"y\" that are considered at this node.\n",
    "4. The breakdown of the simulation results considered into the left and right branches (\"value = [p, 1-p]\"), where \"p\" is the fraction of results that satisfy the `parameter_name = x` constraint, and \"1-p\" the fraction satisfying `parameter_name > x`.\n",
    "5. The classification of the majority of the simulation results at this node (note that this is not a final classification, as it appears in a non-terminal node, and can be arbitrary if the results are split equally across classes).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Terminal** nodes (\"leaves\") represent the final classification of that proportion of the simulation results that arrive at the node, and have most of the same information as a non-terminal node, with the exception that there is no branching performed and hence no sorting variable displayed. Here the most important information is the classification (last line).\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-terminal and terminal nodes colored in blue correspond to the threshold inequality being met, and by following blue boxes from a terminal node up to the root of tree a set of `parameter_name <= x` and/or `parameter_name > x` sorting criteria can be chained together.\n",
    "\n",
    "Upon successful classification, it is usual for the terminal node to have a breakdown \"value = [1.0, 0.0]\" or \"value = [0.0, 1.0]\", indicating that 100% of the remaining simulation results treated are either satisfying the threshold inequality under treatment (left value is 1.0), or not satisfying the threshold inequality (right value is 1.0).\n",
