    "The Resumption from Inactivity scenario evaluates the network's ability to successfully resume activities after a portion of the network has been slashed due to inactivity. While mass slashings of consensus participants should only happen in extreme cases, the current slashing model theoretically allows validators to slash each other for arbitrary reasons. Even though it is too early to simulate specific attacks, it is necessary to further understand the effects of such events - even though the underlying reasons that lead to such an event might not be clear yet. If a high share of validators become inactive due to slashing, the network can become inactive. \n",
