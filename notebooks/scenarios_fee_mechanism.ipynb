    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Fee Mechanism** scenario group is a series of simulations designed to help inform the specification of protocol parameters assumed to impact the fee mechanism. The scenarios cover a variety of different environments for the base fee by simulating different \"shocks\". Different combinations of control and environmental parameter values generate different simulation outcomes, that can be summarized by key peformance indicators (KPIs). The KPIs are then assessed according to desired values (success criteria), using threshold inequalities generated from threshold values for KPIs that meet stakeholder criteria.\n",
    "Specifically, this scenario group covers four subgroups:\n",
    "i) Volatility\n",
    "The volatility scenario tests the effect of secondary market volatility on the volatility of the Base Fee as well as the proftibality of the Sequencer and the Prover\n",
    "\n",
    "ii) L2 Cost Censorship\n",
    "The L2 Cost Censorship scenario tests relative inclusion of L2 transactions by simulating user generated max fee per mana values and comparing them to base fee realizations. \n",
    "\n",
    "iii) Shock Analysis\n",
    "The Shock Analysis scenario tests the effects of L2 network congestion and L1 network congestion (represented through L1 gas prices) on the base fee dynamics. \n",
    "\n",
    "iv) Oracle Sensitivity\n",
    "The Oracle Sensitivity scenario tests the susceptibility of the fee mechanism to small errors propagating via the oracle channel, where \"real\" values can diverge from those used for computation (\"oracle values\") by \"lagging behind\" (slower update frequency and slower magnitude of change)."

Considering that oracles might not be updated (and/or *updateable*) in real-time, and that their maximum change per update might be bounded, there can exist \"lag\" from \"real\" values to the oracle values used for the fee mechanism computation. If these values diverge through lag, users/sequencers/provers might not have access to a realistic cost / profit calculation. The Oracle Sensitivity scenario aims to evaluate the impact of oracle-driven parameters on the transaction fee mechanism within the Aztec network. \n",
